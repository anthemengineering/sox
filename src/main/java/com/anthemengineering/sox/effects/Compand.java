/**
 * <h1>Compand (compress or expand) the dynamic range of the audio.</h1>
 *
 * <p><b>compand</b> attack1,decay1{,attack2,decay2} [soft-knee-dB:]in-dB1[,out-dB1]{,in-dB2,out-dB2} [gain [initial-volume-dB [delay]]]</p>
 *
 * <p><b>The attack and decay parameters</b> (in seconds) determine the time over which the instantaneous level of the input
 * signal is averaged to determine its volume; attacks refer to increases in volume and decays refer to decreases.
 * For most situations, the attack time (response to the music getting louder) should be shorter than the decay time
 * because the human ear is more sensitive to sudden loud music than sudden soft music. Where more than one
 * pair of attack/decay parameters are specified, each input channel is companded separately and the number of pairs
 * must agree with the number of input channels. Typical values are 0.3,0.8 seconds.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>The second parameter is a list of points on the compander’s transfer function specified in dB relative to the
 * maximum possible signal amplitude. The input values must be in a strictly increasing order but the transfer function
 * does not have to be monotonically rising.<br>
 * If omitted, the value of out-dB1 defaults to the same value as in-dB1; levels below in-dB1 are not
 * companded (but may have gain applied to them). The point 0,0 is assumed but may be overridden (by 0,out-dBn).
 * If the list is preceded by a soft-knee-dB value, then the points at where adjacent line segments on the transfer
 * function meet will be rounded by the amount given.<br>
 * Typical values for the transfer function are 6:−70,−60,−20.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>The third (optional)</b> parameter is an additional gain in dB to be applied at all points on the transfer
 * function and allows easy adjustment of the overall gain.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>The fourth (optional)</b> parameter is an initial level to be assumed for each channel when companding starts
 * . This permits the user to supply a nominal level initially, so that, for example, a very large gain is not applied
 * to initial signal levels before the companding action has begun to operate: it is quite probable that in such an event,
 * the output would be severely clipped while the compander gain properly adjusts itself.
 * A typical value (for audio which is initially quiet) is −90 dB.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>The fifth (optional)</b> parameter is a delay in seconds. The input signal is analysed immediately to control
 * the compander, but it is delayed before being fed to the volume adjuster. Specifying a delay approximately equal to
 * the attack/decay times allows the compander to effectively operate in a ‘predictive’ rather than a reactive mode.
 * A typical value is 0.2 seconds.</p>
 *
 * <p>Image soxpng/grohtml-25597.png</p>
 *
 * <p>The following example might be used to make a piece of music with both quiet and loud passages suitable for
 * listening to in a noisy environment such as a moving vehicle:
 *
 * <pre>sox asz.wav asz-car.wav compand 0.3,1 6:−70,−60,−20 −5 −90 0.2</pre>
 * <p>
 * The transfer function (‘6:−70,...’) says that very soft sounds (below −70dB) will remain unchanged.
 * This will stop the compander from boosting the volume on ‘silent’ passages such as between movements.
 * However, sounds in the range −60dB to 0dB (maximum volume) will be boosted so that the 60dB dynamic range of the
 * original music will be compressed 3-to-1 into a 20dB range, which is wide enough to enjoy the music but narrow enough
 * to get around the road noise. The ‘6:’ selects 6dB soft-knee companding. The −5 (dB) output gain is needed to
 * avoid clipping (the number is inexact, and was derived by experimentation). The −90 (dB) for the initial volume will
 * work fine for a clip that starts with near silence, and the delay of 0.2 (seconds) has the effect of causing
 * the compander to react a bit more quickly to sudden volume changes.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>In the next example, compand is being used as a noise-gate for when the noise is at a lower level than the signal:</p>
 * <pre>play infile compand .1,.2 −inf,−50.1,−inf,−50,−50 0 −90 .1</pre>
 *
 * <p>Here is another noise-gate, this time for when the noise is at a higher level than the signal (making it, in some ways, similar to squelch):</p>
 * <pre>play infile compand .1,.1 −45.1,−45,−inf,0,−inf 45 −90 .1</pre>
 * <p>This effect supports the −−plot global option (for the transfer function).</p>
 *
 * <p>See also mcompand for a multiple-band companding effect.</p>
